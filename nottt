i want to create a visually stunning, special and very charming project for new year for my gf. 
Create a mobile-first, aesthetically beautiful, emotional New Year 2026 website that feels like a personal digital scrapbook + handwritten diary, made with deep love and gratitude for “my sweet bubble”.

🌷 Overall Vibe & Emotion

Soft girly aesthetic

Warm pastel tones, blush pinks, lavenders, creams, moonlight blues

Dreamy, emotional, cozy, comforting

The feeling of time flying too fast but every moment being precious

Designed to make her emotional in a good way, like quiet happy tears

Everything should feel handmade, thoughtful, and deeply personal

🎨 Fonts & Design

Use beautiful cursive fonts for headings and emotional text
(handwritten style, aesthetic cursive, diary-like)

Use soft serif or clean fonts for readability on mobile

Smooth scroll, subtle animations, gentle fade-ins

Rounded cards, polaroid photo styles, soft shadows

Fully mobile browser friendly

Optimized for GitHub Pages deployment

📖 Structure of the Website
1️⃣ Opening Section

Soft welcome message like a gentle whisper

Short emotional intro about welcoming New Year 2026

Text should hint that this is something made slowly, carefully, and only for her

Minimal but emotionally warm

2️⃣ Timeline Section: “The Months That Stayed”

A timeline from May 2025 to December 2025

Each month should have:

A polaroid-style photo frame

Placeholder for user’s own images

Each polaroid clickable to play a song associated with that memory

No visible audio buttons cluttering the UI

Soft handwritten captions under each polaroid

Tone of captions

Gentle

Emotional

About how time felt fast

How moments felt warm

How memories quietly stayed

This section should feel like flipping through memories late at night.

3️⃣ Emotional Transition Section

A short text section between timeline and final page:

Theme:

How fast time passed

How good everything felt

How sharing things felt natural

How comfort and happiness quietly grew

Soft background. Slow scroll. Emotional pacing.

4️⃣ Final Page: Handwritten Notebook Page

This section should look like:

A real notebook or diary page

Soft paper texture background

Handwritten font

Slight imperfections to feel human

This page is editable, where the creator will write a personal message about:

Gratitude

How much her presence meant

How things felt good, calm, safe

Saying “love you the most” naturally inside

Ending with:

Forever thankful ❤️

This should feel like reading a private handwritten letter.

💖 Emotional Intent (VERY IMPORTANT)

The website should:

Feel rare

Feel irreplaceable

Feel like something no one else would ever get

Feel deeply personal

Make her pause, smile, and maybe cry softly

Feel remembered forever

🚫 Things to Avoid

No loud colors

No harsh animations

No clutter

No visible audio buttons inside polaroids

No robotic or generic text

✅ Final Output Requirements

Single-page or smooth multi-section layout

Mobile-optimized

GitHub Pages ready

Clean HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript

Easy to replace images and songs

Aesthetic and emotional above everything else
